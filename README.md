# Foot Arch Analyzer
 The Project Foot Arch Analyzer is a system designed to analyze the plantar surface (bottom) of your foot to determine your arch type (flat, normal, high).  It likely uses either a camera or pressure mat to capture the shape of your foot and then employs image recognition or foot pressure analysis to categorize your arch.  This information can be helpful for recommending appropriate shoes or inserts for better comfort and support.
